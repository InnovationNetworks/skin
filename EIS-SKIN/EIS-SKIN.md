**Project abstract**

This project aims at simulating the effects of (combined) interventions for optimising the innovation capacity of public research organisations in Germany, each consisting of multiple more or less tightly coupled individual research institutes. On one hand, the project relies on results of the previous research programme &quot;Enabling Innovation&quot; (EI). On the other, it employs the agent-based SKIN-platform, which will be further developed to represent the &quot;Enabling-Innovation World&quot; of public research organisations on the institute level (EIS-SKIN prototype). Connecting both methods will allow to evaluate (a) effects of (combined) interventions to improve innovation capacity, and (b) which of these interventions prove to be most successful.

In the project, we will simulate context-specific scenarios for various types of public research institutes. These scenarios will provide information on how innovation capacity changes related to certain EI measures. The project will deliver software that facilitates recommendations with adequate predictive accuracy concerning suggested measures for improving innovation capacity in individual public research institutes.

The objective of this project is to provide reliable governance mechanisms for improving innovation capacity while applying EI measures in research institutes.

As a direct benefit for the public research institutes, this might also lead to a more effective and efficient resource allocation and use, and increase their transfer success.

EIS will develop a technology for management consultancy, focused on public research organisations. With this, &quot;Enabling Innovation&quot; will be upgraded to become an especially effective consultancy tool for the enhancement of innovation capacity in public research institutes. In short term perspective, the results of this project can contribute to a more deliberate and effective investment allocation for improving knowledge and technology transfer in research institutes to achieve maximum utility. In medium and long term perspective, this project might even contribute to strengthening the German economy by increasing the frequency and success of transferring academic research into application contexts.

It is essentially an integration and modularisation of other existing SKIN derivates, such as 1) the INFSO model, 2) the IPSE model on entrepreneurs and the creation of start-ups, 3) the model of a market in SKIN. All combined code is organised into &quot;modules&quot;, which can be switched on/off depending on research questions and
modelling purposes. This is done by using prefixes throughout the code, for example the
procedure &quot;learn-from-partners&quot; is now listed as &quot;m:learn-from-partners&quot; with m being the
module prefix.
