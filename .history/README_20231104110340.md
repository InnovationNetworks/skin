Simulating Knowledge Dynamics in Innovation Networks

SKIN is a multi-agent model of innovation networks in knowledge-intensive industries grounded in empirical research and theoretical frameworks from innovation economics and economic sociology. The agents represent innovative firms who try to sell their innovations to other agents and end users but who also have to buy raw materials or more sophisticated inputs from other agents (or material suppliers) in order to produce their outputs. This basic model of a market is extended with a representation of the knowledge dynamics in and between the firms. Each firm tries to improve its innovation performance and its sales by improving its knowledge base through adaptation to user needs, incremental or radical learning, and co-operation and networking with other agents.

SKIN is written using [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/index.shtml). The latest version (v5.32) will run using version [NetLogo 6.3.0.

SKIN has been used in numerous projects, either in its original form or modified to suit the application.  Some of the variations can be found in this repository.  A [bibliography](./SKIN%20Bibliography.md) of works that used or are related to SKIN is also included.
