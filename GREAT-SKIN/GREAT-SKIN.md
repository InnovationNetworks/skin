Project abstract
The GREAT project developed an empirically based and theoretically sound model of the role of responsible research and innovation governance. The project explored the dynamics of participation in research and innovation, and investigated the characteristics of responsible practices. It investigated
(a) the nature of new partnerships among various stakeholders, researchers and policymakers that are developing within innovation networks, and 
(b) the influence that these developments have on knowledge production and policy.

The model builds on the INFSO-SKIN model. 
In GREAT-SKIN, agents represent all the actors of the research and innovation process such as universities, research centres, small and medium enterprises, large multinational corporations, and civil society organisations (CSOs). These agents exhibit the behaviour and interaction of actors in the EU-funded research and innovation system. The model is informed by empirical data to make it as realistic as possible. In the case of GREAT-SKIN, the model was calibrated with empirical data from the CIP-ICT/PSP funding scheme. The model encompasses the following aspects of RRI elements: anticipation—the agents’ and projects’ ability to anticipate the consequences of research and innovation for society—, reflection—the agents’ and projects’ suitability to address the requirements of the funding call—, participation—mirrors the requirement for RRI-sensitive agents such as CSOs to be matched by the actual funded projects—, and responsiveness—reflects the degree of strategy change during the projects. Each project participant is allocated a score for each of these aspects, leading to a RRI score of each organisation, and for each research project. This agent-based model makes it possible to check for aspects of RRI dynamics, which cannot be observed empirically. We can observe and measure the “RRI capabilities” of various agent types and their ability to perform “RRI learning” or to exchange RRI-related knowledge between them.
